R13.1 Terms

a. Recursion:
Recursion is a programming technique in which a method can call itself to solve a problem.
Recursion is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

b. Iteration:
Iteration refers to the process of repeating a set of operations in a loop.
Iteration is typically achieved using constructs like for loops, while loops, or do-while loops.

c. Infinite recursion:
Infinite recursion occurs when a recursive method does not have a base case or stopping condition.
As a result, the method continues to call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.

d. Recursive helper method:
A recursive helper method is a secondary method used to aid the primary recursive method.
It is often used to perform the actual recursive work by handling the recursive calls and managing additional parameters or data.

R13.2 Smallest value

1.Define a recursive function —— findSmallestValue, that takes the array and the current index as parameters.

2.In the recursive function, check if the current index is at the end of the array, which is the base case of the recursion.
If it is, return the value at that index as the smallest value.

3.If the current index is not at the end of the array, recursively call the findSmallestValue function with the array and the next index.

4.During the recursive calls, compare the value returned from the recursive call with the value at the current index and return the smaller of the two.

R13.4 Sort array of numbers

1.Define a recursive function —— recursiveSort, that takes the array as a parameter.

2.The base case. If the array has only one element or is empty, it is already sorted, so it can be returned as is.

3.If the array has more than one element, find the index of the smallest value in the array using a separate recursive function.
This recursive function will find the smallest value in a given sub-array.

4.Once the index of the smallest value is found within the array, swap the element at that index with the first element of the sub-array.

5.Now, recursively call the recursiveSort function on the sub-array that starts from the second element. This will sort the sub-array excluding the first element, which now holds the smallest value.

6.Finally, return the updated array after the recursive call.

R13.6 Exponents recursively

recursive definition of x^n:

Base Case:
If n = 0, then x^0 = 1.
Recursive Case:
If n > 0, then x^n = x * x^(n-1), where x is a given constant.
Termination:
The recursion terminates when n reaches 0, at which point the base case is satisfied and x0 is equal to 1.

R13.8 Factorial recursively
Base Case:
If n = 0, then n! = 1.
Recursive Case:
If n > 0, then n! = n * (n-1)!, where (n-1)! denotes the factorial of (n-1).
Termination:
The recursion continues until the base case is satisfied, at which point 0! equals 1.
